# Soft-Error-Mitigation-in-Register-Files-Using-Self-Immunity-for-Enhanced-System-Reliability
As microprocessors shrink, their vulnerability to soft errors—particularly in critical 
components like register files—has intensified. This project introduces a groundbreaking 
approach called Self-Immunity, which harnesses unused bits within registers to bolster 
error resilience. Through development, verification, and simulation, this technique 
minimizes the impact of soft errors while ensuring low overhead in area and power 
consumption, making it ideal for embedded systems.
